<h1><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOW TO STAY SAFE FROM COVID19</blockquote></h1>
<ul>
<h1>Avoid close contact</h1>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
<li>Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. </li>
</ul><hr/><br>
<ul>
<h1>Clean your hands often</h1>
<li> Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
 <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
 <li> Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.<li>
</ul>

<ul>
<h1>Cover coughs and sneezes</h1>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.</li>
    <li>Throw used tissues in the trash.</li>
    <li>Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<h1>Wear a facemask if you are sick</h1>

    <li><b>if you are sick:</b> You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare providerâ€™s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room.</li>

    <li><b>If you are NOT sick:</b>You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.</li>
